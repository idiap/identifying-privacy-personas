be inferred)",believes that some photos reveal info that is already shared regardless for other purposes,likes relevant ads / relevant ads are useful,does not like relevant ads,"feels that irrelevant ads are useful (e.g., less distraction)",feels that relevant ads are easy-to-spot (they believe they can easily recognise when something is advertised to them),feels that relevant ads create an isolation bubble or feel invasive,feels that ads are annoying,"believes that monetisation could be ok as long certain conditions are met (e.g., anonymisation, giving consent)",found the number of companies/bids surprising when were exposed to how companies can extract data from their images,"does not like that profile data is sold (e.g., makes them feel like a ""commodity"")","believes that inference could be ok as long certain conditions are met (e.g., anonymisation, giving consent)",have mentioned that it is ok for a company to extract/use the data from the images they post online,"have found the inference on images is very shallow (e.g., stereotypical, offensive) when were exposed to how companies can extract data from their images",have mentioned that they do not care about inference on what they do share,have mentioned that they don't like inference on their images,believe that it is too late for them to worry when sharing the images online or do not care about what I reveal,have accepted inference performed by the companies on the images that they share online because this is how the world works,initially believe that not sharing is a safe option when it comes to protecting the personal/private information they share online,"initially believe that image editing could help (e.g., blurring, cropping) when it comes to protecting the personal/private

not sure how to protect the personal/private information they share online",believe that proposed privacy enhancement filter messes up monetisation based on personal data,believe that proposed privacy enhancement filter messes up gathering of personal data and remove objectification,have expressed that a proposed privacy enhancement filter makes the image look better or closer to their taste from their perspective,have expressed that a proposed privacy enhancement filter makes the image look not as good from their perspective,"have expressed that proposed privacy enhancement filter provides

""Filters would not change my day to day life"")",expressed that they would be making a choice between aesthetics of the image and protection when if they were to use a proposed privacy enhancement technology filter,are amazed by the proposed privacy enhancement filter,"does not trust the the proposed privacy enhancement filter (agree to use it only when they understand how the privacy enhancement technology works, or believe that the proposed technology is ""too good to be true"")",believes that privacy is about who has access to image/data inferred from the image,"believes that privacy is about what or how much image / data extracted from an image reveals (identities, lifestyle, etc.)",believes that privacy is about a conscious decision of what to share/hide,"believes that privacy is about what you might “unintentionally” share (e.g., hidden inference from data)",believes that privacy is about controlling who owns your data,believes that privacy is about to whom image/data is sold to,"believes that privacy is about controlling what the image is used for (e.g., for example, not allowing to be a part of the algorithm)","believes that privacy online is deceptive (e.g., information is less private than you think)",believes that privacy online does not exist,believes that privacy is something we do not have full control of
